[Jean-Claude][1] JS. Kind of an ongoing joke.

Development
===========

4 spaces as tabs, favor tabs for indentation, single quotes, and [more when I think of it][2].

### Road Map ###

Kind of a rough cut of what we need to put in. Jean-Claude will do the rest.

    JeanClaude.splits = string.split.
    JeanClaude.Smash = string.join.
    JeanClaude.TimeCop = settimeout.
    JeanClaude.UniversalSoldier = window.
    JeanClaude.SuddenDeath = throw.
    HardTarget = regex ? Yeees.
    JeanClaude.dimMak = ?? Destory something.

We'd also like to see some possible chaining usage too?
